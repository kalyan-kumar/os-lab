Manchester United see off Midtjylland with Marcus Rashford’s debut double
<Description>
An almost unrecognisably callow Manchester United made life difficult for themselves against the footballing midgets of Midtjylland by going behind and then missing a series of chances, including a first-half penalty, before the day was saved by 18-year-old Marcus Rashford, a reserve who found out he was playing only a few minutes before kick-off.

Rashford scored twice in the second half, both convincing close-range finishes, to complete an extraordinary day’s work and keep his side in Europe and his manager in a job, at least for a few more days. It was scarcely the most convincing United performance, yet that hardly mattered in the end. It was scarcely the most convincing United side, but Louis van Gaal clearly has some youthful promise at his disposal. Even Paul Scholes was enthusing about the win at full time, mainly because United had at last managed to increase their tempo and move the ball about with some of their old panache.
Their evening began in the worst way. Already giving a first start to the left-back Joe Riley and playing Michael Carrick at centre-half because of the late withdrawal of Chris Smalling, the home side had to bring in the teenage debutant Rashford as an emergency striker after Anthony Martial injured himself in the warm-up.

Van Gaal really is having no luck with injuries. David de Gea injured himself in the warm-up before the first leg in Denmark last week and Wayne Rooney is out for some weeks to come. Anyone glancing at the United starting lineup might have assumed Van Gaal was fielding a selection of kids and reserves because he was not too concerned about the competition or the result, when nothing could have been further from the case. The Europa League remains the club’s best chance of Champions League football next season and therefore could be crucial to the manager’s future. United needed a result here, and this was the strongest side they could put out.

At least the composed and assured Rashford did not look overawed by the prospect of leading the United attack. He cut in from the left after a quarter of an hour to bring the first save of the game from Mikkel Andersen with a confidently struck shot. United gradually improved after a somewhat shaky start, with Guillermo Varela showing up well on the right, though it was Jesse Lingard who threatened next when he blocked Filip Novak’s clearance and saw the ball ricochet into the side-netting.


It began to look as if Midtjylland might be content to sit on their first-leg lead and let their hosts do the running, an impression quickly shown to be misguided when a free-kick allowed the Danes to set up their first real attacking situation just before the half-hour. Just as he had when scoring in the first leg, Pione Sisto proved quick and elusive. Turning on the edge of the area to take out Daley Blind, he easily evaded Carrick’s rather despairing lunge to make space to slot a low shot beyond Sergio Romero. Now two behind in the tie and with an away goal conceded United’s evening had just got worse still, though despite their youth and inexperience they kept their shape and were back in the game within five minutes.

The impressive Memphis Depay had already seen a shot saved by Andersen when he turned up again on the left, sending over a teasing cross from the goalline that Nikolay Bodurov could only turn into his own net. Thus encouraged, United kept attacking, and would have been in front by the interval had Juan Mata managed to convert a penalty. After Morgan Schneiderlin saw a header come back off a post, Andre Romer brought down Ander Herrera just inside the area, only for Anderson to reach Mata’s accurate but tamely struck attempt from the spot.

Schneiderlin missed a close-range chance at the start of the second half, then helped Depay set up Herrera with a free header, only for the midfielder to miss the target with the goal gaping. Those errors were quickly forgotten when Rashford scored his first United goal, turning up in the right place to bury an almost unmissable opportunity after Mata returned the ball from the left along the six-yard line.

Lingard was booked for diving in search of a penalty, probably correctly, as United stepped up their efforts to find a winner. But with Rashford on the pitch there was no need to go to such extremes. A memorable debut was completed 15 minutes from the end when Varela turned his man neatly on the right to send over a cross that once again found Rashford lurking on the six–yard line to produce an unerring finish.

The teenager might have ended up with a hat-trick had he been permitted to take a late penalty when Kian Hansen handled but, with safety and perhaps Mata’s miss in mind, the task was entrusted to Herrera, who made no mistake. By the time Depay scored a deserved goal to make it five United were playing against 10 men, Romer having received a second yellow card. In the record books in years to come this will look an easy win. It was not quite that.

Great performance. Can say what you want about Midtjylland, but they did knock a.o. Southampton out, and were completely rested for and focused on this match.

The Telegraph just wrote a report on the 55 injuries for Man United this season. Thats a lot of bad luck for any side. Hope to see at least Smalling, Martial and De Gea back on Sunday.

A win over Arsenal is a realistic option with these senior players supporting the talented youths. Great to see so many academy players on the pitch, like a breath of fresh air!

In an article a few days ago the Guardian hinted Mydtjylland would actually be out of form due to the winter break, but I think it's the other way around.

I really think the English schedule is ridiculous, instead of having a half season break, they step up a gear between christmas and new year and if you're in both the FA cup and EL/CL the players can't get enough rest.

This is how little strains become injuries, how clubs like city forfeit the FA cup and perhaps even why England at EC/WC's directly after the season break have a hard time getting results even though their teams on paper should be on level with the top of Europe.

To be fair to LVG he called some of the injuries before they happened. For example before Young got injured he said he was playing in 'red' (which was some reference to likely injury) but all the other injuries at the club meant that he would have to play him and couldn't give him the rest he needed.

<>ohnewitz<>
Absolutely thrilled for Rashford. Remember watching him against Wolfsburg in the youth Team ties and thinking he was still too raw. Very happy he's proved me wrong

<>apulchraludum <>
Enjoy the white washing of a EUROPA team that has not played in two months and beat you the first time. Nothing has changed; Man U will be a laugh to watch for a few years
<>OleP<>
Was at the game, and how fun it was. Yes, the decisive goals came late, but United played Midtjylland off the park for 90 minutes. With the amount of possession and pace the opponents were bound to tire and leave more and more space and time for a so fluent United side it was almost as if Rooney didnt play. Oh, that's right, he did not. Was the vast improvement a coincidence? I think not. Rather be no 5 for two years and let Rashford, Riley (great game) and other youngsters grow and be given an opportunity, playing with sverve and swagger. Also nice to see Scneiderlin playing as good as he did. Arsenal is a completely different quality, but the pace of the team was impressive, albeit not in central defence!

<>
Too many bad performances to take Man Utd and LVG seriously. I expect a defeat against Arsenal next.

<>
Very good to see Giggs smiling again when Rashford scored his second. We need to get Man U back to the place where they can be hated again and it is something to beat them.

<>
1. Memphis seems to be doing well in Europe.. wish he could continue doing the same in League.. now with Martial and Rooney sidelined, he is the only hope
2. Varela's gameplay was simply too good and I hope he becomes the 2nd choice RB after Darmian
3. Schneiderlin was speedy and rocksolid with tackles
4. Rashford's finishes were least expected.. those goals made Utd's participation in the competition special
<>
Whatever Depay had for breakfast, go buy a shitload of the stuff and put it in his fridge! Where the hell did that come from!?:
<>
Probably from the quality of the opposition. I'd love to see him succeed but too many bad performances to take one good one that seriously.

<>
I've defended LVG several times on these pages and perhaps now one or two people are seeing the bigger picture.
As if half the team disappearing when SAF completed his tenure wasn't enough..We had Moyes sacking the coaching staff en masse!
Louis took over a skeleton club compared to previous times. He looked at what he had left....saw a few that were coasting and a couple who needed to move on. Bought a few to fill the gaps left by Fergie...and decided the lads coming up the ranks could be good enough.
The result is 3 or 4 who have been given the nod will make it. And for good measure,there are 3/4 more lads in the 17-18 age group who will also be knocking on the door in the close season.
It feels like 1995 all over again!
<>
This is why to keep LVG? If you want to say that the key is young talent then why did LVG wait until the return leg to break out the young talent?

<>
Very unfair and unprofessional reporting. It was the most convincing performance by United for a long time 

<>
Probably too annoyed that the 'van Gaal on the brink' angle had to be ditched. Midtjylland was very average, but how United played them off the park was impressive still.

<>
What a rubbish piece of reporting! Shame on you Guardian.

If I may be so bold, that might be the most exciting Man United performance I've seen since Fergie retired. Reminiscent of bygone days.

This was a heady mix of youngsters who couldn't believe their luck starting for the 1st team, a few fortuitous injuries, a couple of seasoned pros who'd like to play more often, a youth who was ever so glad his mum remembered to pack his boots, a sense of energy and urgency and application throughout the side and a substandard opposition who capitulated and complied. Oh and a supposedly magic winger who finally turned up for work. Alchemy.

Honestly, when Mata missed that penalty I wasn't worried. We were making so many chances I figured we must score again. It was fabulous! We played with no fear, we ran up the field and tried to beat men and kept trying to score. Yes the opposition were a bit shit in defense, thank god!

Of course, most of these players were never invited to all the meetings where LvG preaches his brand of old bollocks. Therefore they played with abandon for once. Hooray!

Is it the start of some new era? No, but it was vindication of LvG playing youth throughout his tenure. Rashford is the only one we've not seen before, and god bless his cotton socks.

Does it mean we're going to beat Arsenal in the league, West Ham in the FA Cup? Does it mean we'll progress in the UEFA Cup? Will we finish in the top 4. Know what, just for tonight I don't give a rat's ass. Well played United!

PS Well done Nicky Butt!

PPS Bring on Valencia and GNev
<>
A match report that goes on about the match. There's a nice change.

<>
I'm not to surprised with Martial picking up this injury,he just never seems to get any rest.I believe he's played more than any other forward in Europe this season.

<>
The trainers and support staff at Man Utd are not doing there jobs correctly and therefore must take the blame for the number of injuries. Has there ever been a more injury prone centre back in history as Phil Jones? Defenders used to know how to look after themselves on the pitch and never got injured. Its time to clear out the medical and support staff at Man Utd.

<>
We did allright but a big thing i noticed was that how much more fluid our build up was because we had two ball players in central defense..it might not work against top quality opposition...smalling has come leapsa and bounds this season but his distribution has still much to be desired....

<>
Memphis has a lot of talent but has not the best attitude yet. He will grow up once he realizes that a MU player should be remembered for what he has done on the field over time. IT is great to see how this team of young players will get better over time .. and LVG is the best one to guide them. Let us be honest, Carrick, Rooney are beyond their best and as such cannot adapt to LVG style of pla. It is good to keep senior players on hand but they need to lead and not throw a tantrum and or oppose the manager. MU will get it right, LVG will get it right. think longterm not shortterm but the Glazers may not feel like that.
<>
A showpony who can only perform against 'lesser' opposition in Europe. He can't do it in the Premier League. If Mourinho takes over he won't last five minutes- he'll be back on the bench or out the door.

<>
Man United won tonight. But remember this is only against a weaker team. Real test starts against Arsenal. Rashford was brilliant scoring two goals in his debut, but I'd still preferred Martial.

Van Gaal can pick Joe Riley ahead of Borthwick-Jackson. (Rojo is available now so he will be the number one choice though)

Ander Herrera(my favorite) will be the first choice penalty taker from now on. Aren't he?

Memphis was impressive and interesting to watch today. I always supporting him though he has a bad game because I believe in his talent. Hope he will continue to cause a nightmare on every opponents on the next matches.
<>
Rubbish...they may have missed a few chances in the first half (at least they created them) but they totally bossed it second half , pushing their opponents deep into their own half and completely isolating their lone striker who, having been the 'danger man' in the first leg hardly got a sniff of the ball. Thoroughly deserved win.
<>
I think for 25-30 million, playing decently vs a Danish team is the least one would expect. Would hardly sum up doing his job vs this level of opposition as "impressive"....

<>
FFS. I actually thought the performance was decent and more then i hoped for in the end. I mean the injuries are just a nightmare. Credit should be given to the young lads that came in today. Showed spirit, enthusiasm, and decent technique. United lacked a real cutting edge for a lot of the game,and some choices were poor, but for effort i couldn't really fault them. I thought the tempo set for the most part was good.
<>
I would just like to offer my heartiest congratulations to Manchester United Football Club on a stunning, nay epoch-making victory over Midtyl..., Midttul..., Midtu... oh well, you know who I mean.

After this strategic win, Old Trafford is now back the glory days of Best, Law and Charlton.

Good lord, the bounce from this win will make them fancy their chances against Sunderland, Norwich or even Newcastle! The spirit of Matt Busby lives! :-)
<>
Rashford was refreshing. A striker who simply sticks the ball in the back of the net.

<>
Good result. Rashford grabbed his chance didn't he? Hope we see more of him. I've always liked a good poacher.

<>
Well done Utd and well done Van Gaal from a non-Utd fan who was once an enemy and now merely a reminder of what once was.

<>
What is with this report writer? He says 
In the record books in years to come this will look an easy win. It was not quite that.
But but but... 71% possession
25 shots to Utd only 2 shots the whole game from the opposition of which 9 on target from United against 1 on target from Midtjylland. 
He also disrespects the Midtjylland team calling them footballing midgets. We expect this kind of childish name calling from me and other posters on this thread but from a so-called professional writer? Please...
<>
Great to see the youngsters making headlines. Memphis was outstanding but he was against Brugge too. Seems to do well against the so-called 'lesser' sides but can't hack it against Premiership defenders. Let's see how he does come Sunday. Rashford took his chances well and should remain in contention for a place on the bench against Arsenal. Mata was a bit hit and miss and if Jose does arrive in the summer, he'll be given his cards.
<>
it's not entirely because they are lesser sides, mainland football is often a little more spacious where keeping low possession and playing over the width usually invites and breaks up a defence. This suits a player like Memphis.

Typical English defence keep more to their position and are right in your face only when you become dangerous, but participate less in the transition and build up.

If he really isn't as good and supposedly only scores against lesser teams, why haven't the other attackers scored more than him in Europe?
<>
Good result, but I still feel we're going out of this and the FA cup sooner rather than later with LVG and his turgid 'philosophy'.

If it's going to be Mourinho anyway, get him in now and see if he can do the Benitez at Chelsea trick of winning the Europa with zero pressure and expectation.
<>
I would like to offer a hearty cheer to the Utd players who today stood up to be counted - well done for your excellent attitude throughout the game. And to all those silly people who wish to belittle this fine perfomance I would like to say please go and support your own team and be joyous when they win and disappointed when they lose. Stop trying to make yourself feel superior by trying to pull everyone else down to your level.
<>
Youth players, it remains very Manchester United to play a lot of them.


<>
Rashford will get all the headlines, but for me Memphis was absolutely sensational tonight. He put in the best individual performance I have seen from a United player all season.


<>
True that VanGaal was forced by injuries to play such a young side....but only Rashford and Poole in the last seconds made their debut, and they had already been on the bench for PL games.
The likes of Keane, McNair,Borthwick-J, Blackett have been given chances and Shaw, Januzaj and Martial are very young too.
VanGaal maybe deserves some credit for being prepared for tonight's situation by ensuring the club's youth have gained valuable experience under his two year watch and were ready to step in.
p.s. watched Joe Riley playing for the U21's a couple of times, great prospect.
With him and Borthwick-Jackson, time to convert Shaw into the 'new Bale' for next season.
<>
The media will remind us that we were playing nobody. However, at the moment, we are constantly playing a team called Pressure.
The media have reminded us that our Academy is falling behind that of others. However, Rashford, Riley, Lingard et alia take a bow.
Arsenal will be another matter on Sunday and I fear for our defence. However, keep faith in LVG, because Mourinho would put the class of 16 out on loan
<>
Stupid match report. The opposition were poor but United were supremely profesional with a makeshift team. That was a very good performance with the club under extreme pressure. And what a fine showing from the academy, you don't win anything with kids.... maybe the err what's the name of the competition again?


<>
We are back, the reds are back and now know doubters can doubt us. All those 'so called experts' who had the ordascity too call us 'so called fans' must admit that their where wrong and we is the right on this won.

After this I do not no what we can not not go for and I think we should be looking at getting to be 5th in league and to the last 8 in this cup. If we get too the last 8 in these cup then we will soon start to fill how good we are being coming.

Singing all the way home to Ealing central and to western super mare...
<>
Paul Wilson - you are talking pants! I'm proud of United tonight - a team full of young kids playing with pace, tenacity, and they never gave up. Yes it wasn't the greatest of opposition, but those kids restored my pride in the future of my club on the field.

Absolutely nonsense that United squeezed through - and whilst Arsenal on Sunday is a different kettle of fish, tonight those kids got the team through and played like men. I don't care if anyone disagrees with me, the kids did great.
<>
The kids are doing alright.
Lovely to see so many kids wearing the shirt as tradition demands. Rashford is a find and with Riley and Poole also making debuts,the future looks good.....It a certain Portuguese geezer has the patience and wherewithal to carry on what LVG has started here
<>
Pretty much what everyone was predicting. Midtjylland may have won the first leg but they were onto a battering at Old Trafford. Even after they scored you still expected a thrashing and the moment United pulled a goal back the writing was on the wall. Instead of trying to counter the press they remained in their own half, lost the ball most the time and obviously United took advantage of that.

Sisto looks good though and maybe worth a punt from some PL teams.

With Memphis for some reason he can't pull all that out in the league. He's been good in Europe so no surprise he was quite good in a Europa League match. Problem is his profligacy in the league which must be jarring for United fans given if they lose another match 4th looks a tall order unless City screw up and the likes of Southampton and West Ham drop points to at least solidify 5th.

The injuries have actually been a strange positive for United in allowing the youngsters to have a fair shot.
<>
The new Macheda or new Mark Hughes?

For the best part of the game, the kids were carrying the old folk. Varela and Rashford looked the most accomplished players out there, with the exception of Memphis who looked free at last.

It was nice to see Memphis try tricks and take risks. The Winger has traditionally been the one that delights and frustrates because of this but I hope he carries on from now even if sometimes it doesn't carry off. Because being safe and not trying these things can be even more frustrating. A proper winger is supposed to piss off his team mates and supporters for trying the audacious when the simple will do.

Still, Arsenal on Sunday...a whole different ball game...

And our other winger Lindgaard is still nowhere near up to task yet regardless of what anyone else says....Championship player at best...and a good one too...just not up to this level
